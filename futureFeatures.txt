One thing we wanted to add was a conversion option for the user input. Although ounces is the convention in 
the United States, it is standard internationally to use milliliters therefore weâ€™d like to add an option for 
users to select their measurement of choice when inputting data.

Another feature we would like to add is a leaderboard. With this feature, we would like to allow our
users to add friends who also use the app and these users would be ranked based on who had consumed the most water for
the week, and these users would also get bonus points for having daily entries.

The final feature we hoped to add was an alert that pops up when a user has a low water consumption 
after a certain time of day. The purpose of this alert was to remind users to drink more water. This 
feature would allow for users to be more motivated to drink water or input their consumption in the web
app in case they forgot.
